# About EcoBuddy - AI-Powered Climate Education App

## 🌍 **What Inspired This Project**

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, yet traditional environmental education often fails to engage younger generations effectively. I was inspired by the disconnect between scientific knowledge about climate change and actionable behaviors in daily life.

The inspiration came from observing how:
- **Young people** are passionate about environmental issues but lack practical tools to translate concern into action
- **Gamification** successfully motivates behavior change in other domains (fitness apps, language learning)
- **AI technology** has become sophisticated enough to create personalized, interactive experiences
- **AR/ML capabilities** on smartphones are underutilized for environmental education

I wanted to bridge this gap by creating an app that transforms abstract environmental concepts into engaging, personal experiences through the power of AI, gamification, and augmented reality.

   ```java
   @RestController
   public class NarrativeController {
       @PostMapping("/api/narration/start")
       public ResponseEntity<StoryResponse> startStory(@RequestBody StoryRequest request);

       @PostMapping("/api/narration/choice")
       public ResponseEntity<StoryResponse> makeChoice(@RequestBody ChoiceRequest request);
   }
   ```

2. **Database Schema Design**:
   - **Users**: Authentication and profile management
   - **Stories**: AI-generated narrative sessions
   - **Challenges**: Gamification tracking
   - **ScanResults**: Object recognition history
   - **Leaderboards**: Social competition data

3. **Security Implementation**:

   - CORS configuration for mobile app integration

### **AI Integration Strategy**

1. **Google Gemini API Integration**:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class GeminiService {
       public String generateInteractiveStory(String scenario, String userChoice) {
           // Custom prompt engineering for environmental education
           String prompt = buildEcoEducationPrompt(scenario, userChoice);
           return geminiClient.generateContent(prompt);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:
   - **TensorFlow Lite**: On-device object classification for real-time performance
   - **Google ML Kit**: Fallback for complex object recognition
   - **Custom Models**: Trained specific models for environmental objects

### **Database Design & Optimization**

**Mathematical Modeling for Impact Calculation**:

Carbon footprint calculation formula:
$$\text{Total Impact} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{Object}_i \times \text{Weight}_i \times \text{Factor}_i)$$

Where:
- $\text{Object}_i$ = individual scanned object
- $\text{Weight}_i$ = usage frequency multiplier
- $\text{Factor}_i$ = environmental impact coefficient

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Implemented database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Used connection pooling for improved database performance
- Added caching layer for static environmental data

## 🚧 **Challenges I Faced**

### **1. Technical Challenges**

**Real-time Object Recognition Performance**:
- **Problem**: Initial ML models were too slow for real-time scanning
- **Solution**: Implemented hybrid approach using TensorFlow Lite for speed with Google ML Kit fallback for accuracy
- **Result**: Achieved <200ms classification time with 85%+ accuracy

**Cross-platform Compatibility**:
- **Problem**: AR features behaved differently on iOS vs Android
- **Solution**: Created platform-specific implementations with unified interfaces
- **Code Example**:
   ```dart
   class PlatformScanner {
     static ScannerService create() {
       if (Platform.isIOS) {
         return IOSScannerService();
       } else {
         return AndroidScannerService();
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**AI Response Consistency**:
- **Problem**: Gemini API sometimes generated inconsistent story formats
- **Solution**: Implemented robust prompt engineering with structured output validation
- **Template Example**:
   ```
   Generate an environmental education story with exactly this JSON structure:
   {
     "story": "narrative text",
     "choices": ["option1", "option2", "option3"],
     "environmental_impact": number,
     "educational_tip": "learning point"
   }
   ```

### **2. User Experience Challenges**

**Onboarding Complexity**:
- **Problem**: Users found the app's multiple features overwhelming
- **Solution**: Created progressive disclosure with guided tutorials for each feature
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step onboarding with feature unlocking based on usage

**Internationalization Edge Cases**:
- **Problem**: Environmental terms varied significantly between languages
- **Solution**: Built context-aware translation system with regional environmental data
- **Result**: Proper localization for French and English markets

### **3. Data & Algorithm Challenges**

**Environmental Impact Data Accuracy**:
- **Problem**: Limited reliable data sources for carbon footprint calculations
- **Solution**:
  - Collaborated with environmental science resources
  - Implemented confidence intervals for impact estimates

**Gamification Balance**:
- **Problem**: Ensuring rewards motivated real behavior change without being superficial
- **Solution**:
  - Researched behavioral economics principles
  - Implemented variable reward schedules
  - Added community verification for challenge completion

### **4. Integration Challenges**

**API Rate Limiting**:
- **Problem**: Gemini API free tier had strict rate limits
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent request batching and local caching
- **Code**:
   ```dart
   class RateLimitedGeminiService {
     final Queue<ApiRequest> _requestQueue = Queue();
     Timer? _rateLimitTimer;

     Future<String> generateContent(String prompt) async {
       if (_requestQueue.length > MAX_QUEUE_SIZE) {
         return await _getCachedResponse(prompt);
       }
       // Rate limiting logic...
     }
   }
   ```
